I am a 2nd year PhD candidate in the Alelab group of the Electrical and Systems Engineering department at the University of Pennsylvania.<br>

My main research interests are in the areas of wireless communications and machine learning. I am currently working on graph neural network architectures and its application in distributed resource allocation.
