I am a final-year PhD candidate in the [Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering](https://www.ese.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), having the honor to be advised by Prof. [Alejandro Ribeiro](https://alelab.seas.upenn.edu/alejandro-ribeiro/). I received B.E. and M.E. degrees in 2016 and 2019, respectively, advised by Prof. [Cong Shen](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/cong-shen), from the Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).

<span style="color:red">I am currently exploring opportunities for a tenure-track position starting in Fall 2025 and would be happy to discuss any opportunities!</span>
