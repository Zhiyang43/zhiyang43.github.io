I am a 4th year PhD candidate in the [Alelab group](https://alelab.seas.upenn.edu/) of the [Electrical and Systems Engineering department](https://www.ese.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). I received B.E. and M.E. degrees in 2016 and 2019 respectively, from the Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). <br>

My main research interest focuses on the theoretical analyses of the limits of large graph neural networks as manifold neural networks and their applications on analyzing high-dimensional data.
