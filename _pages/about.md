I am a 5th year PhD candidate of the [Electrical and Systems Engineering department](https://www.ese.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Alejandro Ribeiro](https://alelab.seas.upenn.edu/alejandro-ribeiro/). I received B.E. and M.E. degrees in 2016 and 2019 respectively, advised by Prof. [Cong Shen](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/cong-shen), from the Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). <br>

My research is focused on the analysis of geometric graph signal processing in the limit with manifold filters and neural networks. I explore the applications on wireless networks, robotics as well as point cloud analysis. 

<p style="color:red;">I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market and would be happy to discuss any opportunities!</p>
