## Research Interest

My research interests encompass graph signal processing, graph neural networks, geometric data analysis, wireless communications, andscalable autonomous systems. My ultimate goal is to use insights from signal processing to characterize mathematical foundations, develop novel architectures, and devise alternative training procedures for deep learning over real-world geometric data.
